    \\elements, `<audio>` and `<video>`. Each track element lets
    \\you specify a timed text track (or time-based data) that can
    \\be displayed in parallel with the media element, for example
    \\to overlay subtitles or closed captions on top of a video or
    \\alongside audio tracks.
    \\
    \\Multiple tracks can be specified for a media element, containing
    \\different kinds of timed text data, or timed text data that has
    \\been translated for different locales. The data that is used
    \\will either be the track that has been set to be the default, or
    \\a kind and translation based on user preferences.
    \\
    \\The tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (.vtt files) — Web
    \\Video Text Tracks.
